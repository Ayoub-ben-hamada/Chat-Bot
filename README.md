# 🤖 AI Chatbot with Flask, React & Ollama

This project is a simple but powerful AI chatbot built with:
- **Frontend**: React (deployed with Vercel)
- **Backend**: Flask (deployed with Render)
- **AI Engine**: Ollama (runs locally)

---

## ✨ Features

- Clean and responsive user interface
- Chat with LLMs like LLaMA 3 or Phi-3
- Easy to customize and extend
- Communicates with a Flask backend which talks to Ollama

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The **React frontend** sends a message to the Flask API.
2. The **Flask backend** forwards that message to Ollama's local API.
3. Ollama responds with a reply generated by your chosen model (e.g., llama3 or phi3).
4. The reply is displayed in the React interface.
